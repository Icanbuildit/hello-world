# hello-world
I honestly have no idea what I should put here so I am typing this. 
Hi My name is Ashton and I created a GitHub because I want to work with others like me who have an interest in the field of computers. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in CS. Currently the thought of pursuing an AAS in mathamatics. I served in the Army from July 1 2008 to March of 2014 and had a blast doing it. I was originally a health care specialist and a combat medic in the Army and really enjoyed my job. I wanted to get out and try something new. It took me two years after the Army to decide to go back to school and pursue a Masters and maybe an eventual Doctorates in Computer Science. Who knows only time will tell. I am excited to be here and hope to meet a lot of great and talented people on here.
